        <p> Well, this is <strong>Hoda</strong>, I am <strong>28</strong> years old, I was born and raised in <strong>Tehran, Iran</strong>.
          I am the 2<sup>nd</sup> born child in my family and I only have one older sister.
          I moved to Canada on <b>January 1<sup>st</sup> 2022</b>.
          I have a degree in <b>Industrial Engineering</b> back at my home country,
          and <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> is my Second education program.</p>
        
        <p> Now I am going to talk a little bit about my <b>favorite hobbies and activities</b>.
          I recently started playing and learning Tennis which I find it very fun and lovely,
          and I was playing basketball for over 10 years and I am seeking to start it over again.
          I love listening to music and watching movies, my favorite drinks are tea and coffee,
          worth to mention that I am a foodie girl and also enjoy cooking.
          My favorite pet is cat and I go for a walk whenever I am free.</p>
